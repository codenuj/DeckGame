# Deck Game

Design a data structure that represents the generic deck of cards (52-cards, 4-suits, 13-cards/suit).Such a deck should support:

- Shuffling of cards present in the deck.
- Get one or more cards from the deck.
- Return one or more cards to the deck.
- Print the cards present in the deck.

Using the deck designed above, create a game that can be played by two or more players and a single deck. 
Game rules are the following:
- The game starts with each player getting one card from the deck.
- The winner is decided based on the value of the card that he/she is holding. If players have the same value cards, the winner should be decided based on this priority: SPADES>HEART>CLUB>DIAMONDS
